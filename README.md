# Instagram User Analytics

This project performs analysis of Instagram user behaviour and engagement patterns using data export and Excel-driven exploration. Insights derived from the analysis help understand follower growth, post engagement and user interaction dynamics.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📊 Dataset & Scope

- The dataset originates from an Instagram user data export (followers, following, posts, engagement, timestamps etc).  
- The scope of the analysis includes:
  - Exploring follower/following growth trends  
  - Investigating post engagement (likes/comments) across post types and times  
  - Examining the interaction between follower size and engagement metrics  
  - Using Excel only (no programming) for the entire analysis pipeline

## 🧮 Workflow & Methods

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Import exported Instagram data into Excel  
   - Clean and format data: handle missing values, standardise timestamps, categorise post types  

2. **Exploratory Analysis in Excel**  
   - Pivot tables to view trends (followers over time, engagement by post type)  
   - Charts such as line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots to visualise relationships  

3. **Insight Derivation & Interpretation**  
   - Identify key patterns: e.g., high‐engagement post types, times with high interaction  
   - Hypotheses: e.g., “posts with X feature get Y% more engagement”  
   - Suggestions based on findings  

4. **Result Presentation**  
   - Save the key charts/tables in `snapshots/` folder  
   - (Optional) Summary sheet in Excel with major findings and recommendations

## 📝 Key Insights (Example Highlights)

- Posts featuring **[feature X]** garnered on average **XX%** more likes than posts without.  
- A strong correlation between follower count and average engagement, but the marginal increase in engagement diminishes after a certain threshold.  
- Peak engagement hours were found around **[time range]**, suggesting optimal posting schedule.  
- Recommendation: Focus on post type **[Y]**, schedule posts during **[time range]**, and engage with new followers within **[Z] hours** to maximise interaction.
